*    10,000 years ago, Hyrule was a land of prosperity thanks to the Sheikah  *
*    tribe. The Sheikah were a tribe of warriors who protected the Triforce,  *
*    a sacred relic that granted wishes.                                      *

*    But one day, Ganondorf, an evil sorcerer, stole the Triforce and began   *
*    to rule Hyrule with an iron fist.                                        *

*    The princess, with the help of a heroic young man, managed to defeat     *
*    Ganondorf and recover the Triforce.                                      *
